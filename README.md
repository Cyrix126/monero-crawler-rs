### Donation transparency

You can see your donation on 
[Gupaxx Kuno](https://kuno.anne.media/fundraiser/dsrr/).  
The address here is a subadress so I can distinct donations to this project directly instead of Gupaxx, so I can convert them on hours work only for this project.  
In case you don't want to rely on the kuno website, the secret view key is:
